# Vue Resume Portfolio

This is a personal resume website built using Vue.js to showcase my experience, technical projects, and background in software development. It includes animated interactions and a stylized layout designed to reflect both professionalism and personality.

## Features

- About page with a brief introduction and summary
- Experience section with a carousel-style breakdown of work and education
- Project video page with embedded demos and descriptions
- JavaScript-powered animations and interactive elements

## Stack

- Vue 3  
- JavaScript  
- CSS  
- Vite  
- Git / GitHub

## Purpose

This site was created as both a portfolio and a way to explore layout control, animation, and component-based design. The structure and content were customized to present my work in a more visual and engaging format than a traditional resume.

## Custom Artwork/Animations

The picture frames in the Experiences tab and the Home page paintings were made using ChatGPT, but all other images are mine and made by me for this project.
