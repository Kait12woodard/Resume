    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        My journey into software engineering hasn't followed a straight line —
        but it's that winding trail that's shaped me into a curious, adaptable,
        and driven developer.

    <div class="early-years">
      <p>
        Right out of high school, I jumped into both work and college. I started
        as a Sandwich Artist at Subway while attending Portland Community
        College full-time. I quickly moved into a Shift Lead role, taking on more
        responsibility and discovering how much I enjoyed solving problems and
        helping a team grow.

    <div class="finding-direction">
      <p>
        At PCC, I focused on general studies while exploring a variety of
        subjects to find my direction. When I relocated to the Salem area, I
        joined Carhartt as a Brand Ambassador. After finishing my associate's
        degree, I continued growing professionally and eventually worked my way
        up to Supervisor. That role gave me the opportunity to develop real
        leadership skills — from team communication to problem-solving under
        pressure.

    <div class="tech-spark">
      <p>
        It was during this time that I became “the techy one” at our store —
        the person everyone turned to for troubleshooting software, submitting
        IT tickets, and making sense of the tools we relied on. That experience
        sparked something deeper: a desire to understand not just how the
        systems worked, but how they could be improved.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="college-journey">
      <p>
        So I made the leap and enrolled at Western Oregon University to pursue a
        Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Over the course of three years,
        I gained hands-on experience with full-stack development and deepened my
        understanding of how software is built from the ground up. For a few
        months during that time, I also worked as a research assistant for a CS
        professor, where I explored AI tools and created educational videos to
        support student learning — a unique project that expanded both my
        technical and creative skill sets.

    <div class="personal-growth">
      <p>
        During this transition, I was fortunate to be supported by my husband,
        which allowed me to fully focus on my education and growth. That time
        gave me the space I needed to invest in becoming the engineer I am today.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="now">
      <p>
        Now, I'm excited to bring my background in leadership, user experience,
        and full-stack development into the software industry. Whether working
        on front-end interfaces or back-end systems, I'm passionate about
        building thoughtful, resilient tools — and telling a great story through
        the code I write.
